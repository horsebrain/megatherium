Parametric 3D Modeling Kernel
A 3D modeling kernel stores a representation of a 3d object in memory and allows importing, manipulation, and exporting of that object.
'Parametric' refers to the way that the 3D model is based on driving parameters and can be regenerated based on changing one of those parameters.
